Session-02 Data Types and Operators
-------------------------------------
Last variable  and primitive data type

non-primitive data type 
1.Object
      var mobile=
             {
               "price":30000,
			   "brand":"Apple",
			   "ram":"2GB"
             }	

        mobile.price=160000;
        console.log(mobile.price)		
2.Array 
    -> Array is a technique to store multiple values in single variable.
	
	var fruit=["Apple","Mango","Jackfruit"];
	index -> it is defult numbering ,starts with 0th position 
	element->  a value we stored in the index number 
	
	there are 2 types array 
	1.single dimesion (1d)
	2.multiple dimesion(2d)

Operator ->  it is a symbole to perform specific operation on operand 
        
		there are 3 category of the operators 
		1. Unaray  - single/one . 
		     Which operator perform operation on single operand 
			 that is called unary operator 
			  increment and decrement;
			  ++ 
			  --
			  var a=10;
			  a++
			  a+1
			  
			  a--
			  
			  
			 
		2. binaary   two/double 
		    a symbole perform operation on 2 operands 
			 var a=10;
			 var b=20;
			 var c=a+b;
			 Arithtmetic  +-/*
			 assigment    =
			 logical      &&  ||  ! true or false 
			 comprasion operator   > ,>= < , <= true or false
		3.ternary    three
