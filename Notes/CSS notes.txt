CSS NOTES:
==========
 A CSS rule contains two parts: 1.selector and 2.declaration.
 Ex.
 p{font-family:Arial;}
 In above example p is selector and remaining is declaration.
 
 Selectors: indicate which element the rule applies to. 
 
 Declarations: indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. 
 
 CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: 
 1.property and 2.value, separated by a colon. 
 
 Ex. h1,h2,h3{font-family:Arial; color:yellow;}
 In above example color is property and yellow is value.
 
 Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. 
 
 Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.
 
 EXTERNAL CSS:
 =============
 <link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>
 
 Above is a link for external css.
 
 <LINK>
 ======
The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.
 
 href
 ====
This specifies the path to the CSS file.

type
====
This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.

rel
===
This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.

An HTML page can use morethan one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have a <link> element for every CSS file it uses. 

INTERNAL CSS:
=============

<style>
You can also include CSS ruleswithin an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element,which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page. 

The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be text/css.

CSS Selectors:
==============
There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document. 

CSS selectors are case sensitive, so they must match element names and attribute values exactly.

1. Universal Selector        *{}
2. Type Selector             h1,h2,h3{}
3. Class Selector            .note{}
4. ID Selector               #introduction{}
5. Child Selector            li>a {}
6. Descendant Selector       p a {}
7. Adjacent Sibling          h1+p {}
   Selector
8. General Sibling           h1~p {}
   Selector
